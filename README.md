Module 1 Challenge: HTML, CSS, Git

## Description

This project began with starter code that needed to be modified to make more accessible. 

## User Story

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
